# Hi üëã

**I‚Äôm Marie-Christ Sagbo**

I‚Äôm a **Software Developer** passionate about building digital products that make a difference.  
Curious by nature, I love exploring everything around **Data** and **Artificial Intelligence**, even if I‚Äôm just starting that journey.  
My path in tech has been shaped by curiosity, challenges, and a desire to always go further üöÄ.  


## My Story  

In **2022**, right after my high school diploma, I decided to dive into the world of programming.  
I started small: following courses on [**OpenClassrooms**](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/) and watching [**Grafikart tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/@grafikart) on YouTube.  
Step by step, coding went from curiosity to passion.  

Not long after, I had my first professional experiences as a **Frontend Engineer** at **Natex Services** and **The Creative Mind**.  
These roles taught me not only how to build user interfaces, but also how to collaborate in real projects, facing real deadlines.

## üèÜ Hackathons & Achievements  

Hackathons have been a playground where I push myself, learn quickly, and collaborate with other passionate developers.  

- üèÜ **Winner ‚Äì Hub Innovation Hackathon** (University of Parakou + S√®m√® City)
